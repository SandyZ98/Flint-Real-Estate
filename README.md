# An analysis of residential home values after the Flint water crisis

by *Ilse Paniagua* and *Zeping Tao*

### Abstract

This project examines the effect of the Flint water crisis on residential home values between 2010-2017. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), tax assessment data (Zillow), and home sale prices (Zillow), we found that only the ACS measure of a home's value showed a sharp decline after the Flint water crisis. Averaged at the tract level, our results also revealed large differences between administrative records (tax assessments and home sale prices) and the ACS question that asks respondents to estimate their home value. These differences were between 10,000 and 50,000 dollars for all census tracts in Flint. Finally, we provide visualizations showing perceived home value changes in Flint by census tract. Future research could design an experiment to casually estimate the measurement error associated with asking respondents to provide their home values under conditions of potential market change.
