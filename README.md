# An analysis of residential home values after the Flint water crisis

by *Ilse Paniagua* and *Zeping Tao*

### Abstract

This project examines the effect of the Flint water crisis on residential home values between 2010-2017. We use data from the Census American Community Survey (ACS), tax assessments and home sale prices gathered through the Zillow API. We found that only the ACS measure of a home's value showed a sharp decline after the Flint water crisis. Averaged at the tract level, we also found large differences between administrative records (tax assessments and home sale prices) and the ACS question that asks respondents to estimate their home value. Finally, we provide visualizations showing perceived home value changes in Flint by census tract. Future research could design an experiment to casually estimate the measurement error associated with asking respondents to provide their home values under conditions of potential market change.
